# Bootloader Program

This repository contains the source code for a bootloader program written by Ammar Khalil.

## Description

The bootloader program is designed to facilitate the updating of firmware on embedded systems. It provides functionality to communicate with the device over UART, receive firmware updates, perform CRC checks, erase flash memory, and jump to the user application. Additionally, it includes features for sending version information, unique chip ID, help messages, and diagnostic messages for debugging purposes.

## Features

- UART communication for receiving firmware updates
- CRC checking to ensure data integrity
- Flash memory erasing and writing capabilities
- Ability to jump to the user application
- Sending version information and unique chip ID
- Providing help messages and diagnostic information

## Installation

To use the bootloader program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Include the necessary header files (`Bootloader.h`, `Macros.h`, `USART.h`, `FLASH.h`, `CRC.h`) in your project.
3. Configure the UART settings according to your hardware specifications.
4. Compile the code and program it onto your device.

## Usage

To use the bootloader program:

1. Ensure the bootloader is opened or triggered according to your application logic.
2. Send commands over UART to perform desired operations, such as updating firmware, erasing flash memory, or jumping to the user application.

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use the bootloader program:

```c
// Include necessary header files
#include "Bootloader.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize the bootloader
    Bootloader_Initialize();

    // Start the bootloader operation
    Bootloader_Start();

    return 0;
}
