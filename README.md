# IoT Firmware Deployment System

## Overview
This project aims to streamline the process of firmware development and deployment for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Leveraging MQTT protocol for efficient communication, our system simplifies the workflow from firmware creation to deployment onto embedded hardware.

## Key Features
1. **PC-based Firmware Development:** Developers can create and fine-tune firmware for IoT devices using familiar development environments on their personal computers.
2. **MQTT Protocol Integration:** Secure and reliable communication between devices and servers is ensured through the lightweight MQTT protocol, facilitating seamless transmission of firmware files.
3. **Raspberry Pi Server:** Raspberry Pi 4 serves as the deployment server, enabling developers to upload firmware files, which are securely stored and made accessible for deployment to target devices.
4. **Embedded Deployment:** Firmware files uploaded to the Raspberry Pi server are sent to another Raspberry Pi 4, acting as a bridge to the target IoT devices. Using UART communication, the firmware is flashed onto STM32F103 boards, enabling real-time deployment without manual intervention.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency:** Accelerates firmware development and deployment, reducing time-to-market for IoT solutions.
- **Reliability:** Minimizes the risk of data loss or corruption during deployment through reliable MQTT transmission.
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture allows for seamless scalability to accommodate a growing fleet of IoT devices without compromising performance.

## Target Audience
This IoT Firmware Deployment System caters to developers and engineering teams working on IoT projects, offering them a powerful tool to expedite the development and deployment process while maintaining reliability and scalability.
